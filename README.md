## > Project Insight
# 1. General Super Market Sales Dashboard
# Key Metrics:
- Sum of COGS: 307.59K
- Sum of Gross Income: 15.38K
- Sum of Total Sales: 322.97K
- Sum of Quantity Sold: 5510
- Avg. Unit Price: 55.67

# Insights:
# Top Selling Product Lines by Quantity:

- Electronic Accessories (971), Food & Beverages (952), Sports & Travel (920).
â†’ These three categories are driving the bulk of sales volume.

# Branches Performance:
-Branch A (34%), B (33.2%), and C (32.8%) are performing almost evenly.

# Payment Methods:
- All three methods (E-wallet, Cash, Credit Card) are almost equally popular, slightly higher for Cash.

# Tax Trends:
- Average 5% tax has declined slightly from January (15.5) to March (15.0), showing lower revenue in March compared to January.

# ðŸ“Œ Takeaway:
Sales are well-diversified across branches and product categories. However, thereâ€™s a slight dip in revenue in Q1 (Janâ€“Mar), which needs investigation.

# 2. Super Market Dashboard (The Gross Income Focus)
# Top Gross Income by Product Lines:

- Food & Beverages (2.7K), Sports & Travel (2.6K), Electronic Accessories (2.6K).
- Health & Beauty is the lowest contributor (2.3K).
- Gross Income by Branch:
- Branch A (34.24%) outperforms, B and C (32.88% each) are tied.
- Gross Income by City:
- Mandalay leads with 5.27K (34.24%).
- Yangon & Naypyitaw contribute equally (5.06K, 32.88%).

# Monthly Trends:
- February was the weakest month in both total sales and gross income.
- Recovery visible in March, but not yet back to January levels.

# ðŸ“Œ Takeaway:
- Food & Beverages and Sports & Travel dominate profits. February slump suggests seasonality or external factors (e.g., demand dip). Mandalay appears to be the strongest city market.

- Health & Beauty is lowest (49K).

# City Contribution to Total Sales:
- Mandalay (110.57K) tops, Yangon & Naypyitaw tied at 106.2K.

# Customer Types:
- No strong difference shown between Members vs Normal.

# Monthly Trends:
- Similar dip in February followed by partial recovery in March.

# ðŸ“Œ Takeaway:
Sales are concentrated in Food, Sports, and Electronics. Branch A and Mandalay city outperform slightly, which aligns with higher gross income from Dashboard #2. February remains a weak month across all metrics.

## >> Overall Cross-Dashboard Insights
# Top Product Lines:
- Food & Beverages, Sports & Travel, and Electronics drive both quantity and revenue.
- Health & Beauty is consistently the weakest performer.

# Branch & City Performance:
- Branch A and Mandalay slightly outperform others.
- But branches and cities are fairly balanced (no single dominant one).

# Payment Preference:
- Customers split payments almost evenly between Cash, E-wallet, and Credit cards.
- This indicates flexibility and no dependency on one method.

# Seasonality:
- February is a weak month across all metrics â†’ needs further analysis (holidays, supply issues, or low demand).

## >>> âœ… Business Recommendations:
- Focus promotions on Health & Beauty to boost its performance.
- Investigate February sales slump and prepare mitigation strategies.
- Leverage Mandalay + Branch A as strongholds while boosting weaker locations.
- Push top-performing product lines (Food, Sports, Electronics) with upselling or bundles.
